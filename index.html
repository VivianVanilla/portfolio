       <a href="https://thieves-key-coder.vercel.app/"> <h3> Thieves Cant Coder </h3> </a> 
       This is an express app hosted on Vercel. It is a basic "encryptor", that uses ASCII and basic math to turn words into random characters based on a 
       specified code. Make your own secret codes!

       <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/power-words/pggbdepkdkekblaolebcplihhbcmcabe?hl=en"> <h3> Power Words Extension </h3> </a> 
    My first work using extensions! It's meant to be a prank extension that reacts to different words and creates different
    effetcs. Currently only the word "fire" has a unique effect.
        But I plan to add more in the future, check it out and see what happens!

       <a href="https://vivianvanilla.github.io/ToDoApp/"> <h3> To Do App </h3> </a> 
    I have loved sticky notes my entire life, they make life oraganized. They make it make sense! So when I was assigned to
    make a "to do"
       app for a project in MTEC I decided to make it sticky notes. You can create stickies, change their colors and group them! I will comeback one 
       day to revamp it further!

     <div> 
        
       <a href="https://vivianvanilla.github.io/loosestreakgan/"> <h3> Lose Streak Counter </h3> </a> 
        This is a web app, developed using <a href="https://developer.riotgames.com/apis">Riot Api</a>. Which tracks an online game 
        and all games played in game. I have coded it so every so often this website checks the status of my friend Logan and if
        they have been playing well,
        mostly just a fun idea.

       <div> 
        
       <a href="https://vivianvanilla.github.io/MovieApp/"><h3> Basic Movie App </h3> </a> 
    This is an app made using <a href="https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started">TMBD </a> You can
    favorite, and browse through thousands of movies.
       This is an early project from what I can do now, so the CSS look is rough but functional.
